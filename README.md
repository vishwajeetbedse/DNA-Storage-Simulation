# DNA-Storage-Simulation
A DNA Data Storage Simulator built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This tool encodes text into DNA bases, displays the sequence as both a character string and an interactive horizontal ladder (with correct A-T/C-G bonding), calculates relevant stats, and includes a manual decoder.
