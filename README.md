# üß¨ DNA Data Storage Simulator

An interactive web application that demonstrates the concept of encoding digital data into synthetic DNA molecules. This tool provides a hands-on simulation of the entire process, from text input to a visual, scientifically-accurate DNA ladder output.

## üöÄ Features

This simulator is built with pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and includes:

* **Text-to-DNA Encoding:** Instantly converts any text input into its corresponding 4-bit DNA base (A, T, C, G) sequence.

* **Dual-View Visualization:** Choose how you want to see the data:

  * **DNA Ladder View:** A scientifically-accurate, horizontal, scrollable model of the double helix. It correctly renders **two hydrogen bonds for A-T pairs** and **three hydrogen bonds for C-G pairs**.

  * **Character View:** A simple, color-coded string of the primary DNA strand, perfect for copying and pasting.

* **Real-World Statistics:** See illustrative stats based on your encoded data, including:

  * Total DNA Base Count

  * Original Data Size (in KB)

  * Estimated Physical Mass (calculated from the average mass of a nucleotide).

* **Manual Decoder Tool:** A reverse tool that lets you paste in a DNA sequence to see what text it decodes to. This is great for "mutating" (editing) a sequence to see how it corrupts the data.

* **Interactive Help System:** Each step features a "?‚Äù icon with a pop-up modal explaining the science and functionality of that section.

* **Fully Responsive:** Designed to work smoothly on both desktop and mobile devices.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

This project is built from scratch with zero dependencies, using only:

* **HTML5:** For the core structure and content.

* **CSS3:** For all styling, animations, and the responsive grid/flexbox layouts.

* **JavaScript (ES6+):** For all application logic, including the encoding/decoding, visualization rendering, and DOM manipulation.
